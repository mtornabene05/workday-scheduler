# Work Day Scheduler

## Description
This application can be used to generate a work day calender to allow you to keep track of meeting or any other obligations throughout the day. All events are color coordinated based on time (past/present/future). All scheduled items are fully editable and once saved will still be on that page for you no matter how many times you refresh the screen!
